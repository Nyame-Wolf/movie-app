# MovieFlix App

**In this project [@rominana](https://github.com/rominana) and [@Nyame-Wolf](https://github.com/Nyame-Wolf), created a movie app to rate and comment your favorite movies, as part of the Module2 Vanilla Javascript Capstone project.**
**It uses the [tvmaze Api](https://api.tvmaze.com) to list shows. It has a comment popup which displays the show summary, image, number of comments and the comments, as well as a form to add more comments. It also displays the number of shows displayed, as well as the number of likes a show has received. The comment popup and the likes use the [involvement api](https://www.notion.so/Involvement-API-869e60b5ad104603aa6db59e08150270) provided by Microverse.**
